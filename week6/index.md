# Week 6 – Performance Monitoring and Evaluation

## Objective
System performance characteristics and resource usage was observed.

## Performance Monitoring Tools
Basic Linux monitoring tools were used to observe system performance, including:
- `top` for CPU and memory usage
- `free` for memory availability
- `uptime` for system load averages

---

## Observations
Load averages were low
Server showed low CPU and memory usage
Memory usage was stable
Sufficient free and available memory for server workloads 

There was no abnormal resource consumption.

---

## Evaluation
This shows that the virtual machine has sufficient resources for its intended purpose.
